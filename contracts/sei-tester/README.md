# Testing and Example Contract

This package primarily serves as testing support for the sei-cosmwasm package.
It includes an example contract that can be used to test package behavior 
locally and can be used as a reference for implementation details to include 
sei-chain integration in your smart contracts.

## Examples

### Call an EVM contract from a CosmWasm contract

First we need deploy an EVM contract on the Sei chain. Let's use a simple counter contract and
foundry tooling to deploy it.

Install the [foundry tooling](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) by following this [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).

```shell

```solidity

```
